# CU-Later: A Comprehensive Second-Hand Marketplace & Community Platform for CUHK

![CU later Home](app/public/img/cu-later-home.png)

CU-Later is a dedicated platform for the CUHK community, addressing the need for a local marketplace for second-hand items and a community page for promoting CUHK activities. CU-Later aims to streamline the exchange of valuable items and information within the campus community.

The platform is particularly beneficial for students and staff frequently moving in and out of on-campus hostels, and departments seeking to exchange items. It addresses the limitations of existing systems by providing an organized, user-friendly platform with detailed item information and immediate access.

CU-Later not only supports environmental sustainability by promoting reuse and reducing waste, but also fosters community engagement. By facilitating a circular economy and a vibrant community page, CU-Later contributes to a more sustainable and interconnected campus community.
